# CIS4400-Project-HW

**Bike Share Project:** Evaluate the correlation between bike usage patterns and time/location based factors (such as time of day, week, and station location) from January 1st 2024 to December 31st 2024, to optimize bike redistribution and improve bike service efficiency. 

# Goals

**1) Compare Trip Volume vs Station Bike Capacity**

- I will determine if bike availability and capacity at each station align with the actual usage. If there are any inconsistencies I will be able to spot operational inefficiencies or if there is a need for station relocation or expansion. 

**2) Visualize  Rider Tends Across LA**
- I will use charts to display trip volume over time to not only identify patterns in user spikes but to also optimize service schedules and marketing for certain locations.

**3) Map Usage Density by Location**
- I will be able to visualize spatial data to see which stations or neighborhoods are most heavily used. This helps identify underserved areas, plan new stations, or enhance connectivity.

**4) Assess Operational Efficiency**
- Identify anomalies or inefficiencies by analyzing trip durations. Very short or very long rides might signal misuse of equipment, lost bikes, or design flaws in the system.

# Business Impact and Persona 
Metro Bike Share data supports a diverse set of urban transportation stakeholders who have operational, planning, and community engagement responsibilities. These include transportation planners, city mobility teams, bike share program managers, and local government agencies. These users rely on accurate and timely usage data to optimize bike availability, enhance rider experience, guide infrastructure investments, and promote sustainable transportation.

# Benefits and Specific Key User Data Applications

**Bike Share Operations Managers**

Role: Oversee the daily logistics of bike availability, maintenance, rebalancing, and user support.

Real-time and historical data allow these managers to: 
- Rebalance bikes more effectively based on usage trends.
- Schedule maintenance based on mileage or anomalies in ride patterns.
- Allocate staff for redistribution at peak times and locations.

**Sustainability Officers**
Role: Promote eco-friendly transportation options and ensure equitable access across communities.

Using geographic and demographic data, they can:
- Measure impact of bike share on traffic congestion and emissions.
- Identify underserved areas and propose station installations in equity zones.
- Monitor usage to support funding applications and community outreach.

**Marketing and Customer Engagement Teams**
Role: Drive user adoption, increase memberships, and build community partnerships.

Trip trends and pass type analysis help them:
- Tailor promotions by time of day or user behavior (e.g., commuters vs. tourists).
- Segment campaigns by location or seasonality.
- Retain users by aligning services with actual ride patterns.

# Challenges 

**Data Completeness and Consistency:**
Some ride records may contain missing or malformed station names or trip durations that need to be cleaned and standardized.

**Temporal and Spatial Granularity:**
Usage varies significantly by hour and locationâ€”failing to analyze data at the right resolution could lead to incorrect operational decisions.
