# Metro Bike Share Data Architecture

# Overview
The data architecture for this project outlines how Metro Bike Share data will be sourced, processed, stored, and consumed. It ensures that the information architectureâ€™s analytical needs are met by providing structured data pipelines and storage, maintaining data quality, and enabling effective reporting.

# Key Components

**Source Systems**

Metro Bike Share Open Data Portal:
 - Raw trip data in CSV format, published monthly, includes trip ID, duration, start/end station, timestamps, pass type, and bike ID.

**Data Integration & ETL Process:**

- Tools: Python scripts and cloud-based tools (Azure)

**ETL Workflow:**

- Extract CSV files from the public portal.

- Cleanse and normalize data (e.g., standardize timestamps, handle missing values).

- Transform fields (e.g., calculate trip duration in minutes, extract date/time dimensions).

- Load into a centralized cloud database (AWS Redshift).


# Master Data Management (MDM)

**Define and standardize reference data:**
- Station names and IDs
- Pass type categories (Monthly, Flex, Walk-up)
- Ensure consistency across monthly data files and time series.


**Data Quality** 

**Implement validation checks:**
- Remove incomplete or duplicate trips.
- Verify timestamp formats and station matching.
- Identify and correct outliers in trip duration.

# Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)

**Storage Format:** 
 - Star schema with a fact table (Trips) and dimension tables (Date, Station, User Type)

**Scalability:**
 - Cloud-native architecture for flexible storage and querying large amount of records.

# Information Consumption (BI Tools)
 
 **Tableau dashboards used for:**

- Visualizing bike trip patterns
- Filtering data by time, station, and user type
- Generating reports for planning and operations
- Data Analysts and Stakeholders: Access reports through secure dashboards with role-based permissions.

# Benefits
- Supports operational decision-making through reliable and timely insights.
- Enables data governance by applying master data and quality standards.
- Scales to accommodate new trip data over time.
- Facilitates secure access and intuitive reporting for non-technical stakeholders.
